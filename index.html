            <h2>Restaurant Story</h2>
            <p>We started with just one charcoal grill selling halal chicken kabobs on the street. After a few yrs of
                selling out daily we decided to purchase a commercial building and broaden our horizons by finding some
                of the best and diverse cooks in town. Now we have the #1 ranked restaurant in town and we thank Allah
                for the success</p>
